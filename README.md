# backrooms.htm

This repo replicates Scott Viteri's "Universal Backrooms" (https://github.com/scottviteri/UniversalBackrooms) (specifically [cosmicoptima's fork](https://github.com/cosmicoptima/UniversalBackrooms)), itself a replication of Andy Ayrey's "Backrooms" (https://dreams-of-an-electric-mind.webflow.io/), rewritten in typescript and runnable in a browser, so you can watch the backrooms on mobile with your own API keys.

**I know it's insecure to put your API keys in a browser, so use at your own risk.**

I recommend using openrouter over the other options because it doesn't have the same rate limits. But using Hyperbolic's 405b-base model is really fun!

## Usage

To run locally, first install packages with `pnpm i` then run the development server with `pnpm start`.
